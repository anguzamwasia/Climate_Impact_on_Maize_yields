## **Effects of Climate Change on Maize Production in Kenya**

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## Project Description
This project analyzes the relationship between climate variables and maize production in Kenya using statistical methods and data visualization techniques. The goal is to understand how climate change impacts agricultural productivity and to inform resilience strategies.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data exploration and cleaning  
- Statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, skewness, kurtosis)  
- Outlier detection and visualization  
- Analysis of the climate-yield relationship  

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anguzamwasia/Climate_Impact_on_Maize_yields.git
cd Climate_Impact_on_Maize_yields 
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows use 
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Effects_of_Climate_Change_on_Maize_Production_.ipynb
```

## Dataset

The dataset `Maize_merged_dataset.csv` includes:
- 282 entries  
- 24 variables, including:
  - Maize production metrics  
  - Climate indicators  
  - Soil conditions  

## Results

Key findings from the analysis:
- Significant variation in maize yield across counties  
- Identification of climate variables most correlated with yield  
- Detection of outliers requiring further investigation
